In short:
All the projects and files from my YouTube Channel (https://youtube.com/c/codingwithshawn) can be found here. Thanks for visiting!

In detail:
I run a YouTube Channel at youtube.com/codingwithshawn where I teach people like you how to code. To write code, you have to create a file. Files you may have seen before include something.mp4, helloworld.py, and more.
All the files I use or have used in my videos are available in this repository.

Note: If you ever find any issues in any of the files here, feel free to report them using the issues tab or by [clicking here.](https://github.com/codingwithshawn/codingwithshawnyt/issues)
